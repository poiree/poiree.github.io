But curently its future is unclear. It has been pending for client's confirmation on various points for a long time now.</p><p> Chronologically this wasn't the next project after the website for the law firm. Before that I worked some with Wordpress, including one of the projects farther on the list. Wordpress is considered "blog-oriented" CMS so to speak. So after making its acquaintance I decided to try to use it for what it was created. It was decided then to develop new (more modern and interesting-looking) version of the existing blog.</p><p> Actually, there isn't much to tell about the development process, since it was supposed to be just a blog and nothing else. It pretty much consisted of choosing a theme, editing it a little, adding some styling to it, and configuring a few plugins (such as custom fields, infinite scroll and subscription form for example).</p><p> P.S. More about my journey through Wordpress world can be found in next projects.</p></div></body> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/modernizr/2.8.3/modernizr.min.js"></script> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="js/main.js"></script> </body></html>
