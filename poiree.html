			This was my first try ever at web development. I practically didn't know anything at all. But it was this project that made me dive
			into this professional area.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because this was basically just an experiment at what web development is and what it feels like, it was built with website constructor.
			Hardly any web technologies were used "by hand". But still this project is somewhat special to me, because it made me want to learn to
			do this things by myself (instead of just dragging and dropping items and editing their dimensions and content) thus becoming the
			begining of a long way of learning and working hard.
