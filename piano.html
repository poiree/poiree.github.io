		<h2>Virtual Piano</h2>
		<p>
			This was my final project for Introduction to Computer Science Harvard course on edx.org.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was combining one of my passions with attempting to produce an example of interactive web application using only pure HTML and CSS
			and jQuery javascript library. It was the first completed web-project I developed by coding and not with web-page constructor. It was
			scary and confusing but turned out to be very exciting. I started out developing it with pure javascript but later (after final
			project admisson) I rewrote it with jQuery.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was also the most "media-oriented" project I had ever worked with. It required a lot of specialized studying. Aside from keybord
			drawing challenge (which took a lot of time) there was sound producing, music score generating and downloading image of a final score.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is a simple web application, it doesn't contain real deep-level operations. It was, after all, just a study project. But I had to
			try out many different completely new (for me) things, play around with them, while trying to come up with the way to make my ideas
			realized and functional.
		</p>
		<p>P.S. Oh, and by the way, there is no version of this app for mobile devices, because, I can honestly admit, that I can't yet come up
			with a way to place a piano keyboard on a small narrow screen, never mind doing it in such a way as to make it possible to hit keys
			with a finger.
