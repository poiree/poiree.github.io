In this project I worked a lot with shortcodes. I used php-shortcode plugin through wich I added some concepts from previous project like displaying posts from specific category in certain way and displaying data from posts custom fields. And I used another shortcode plugin for basically everything else. Through those shortcodes I added specific scripts and styles to specific pages. Of course there were a lot of the same stuff as in previous project, like posts cutom fields, image galleries and so on.</p><p> The most fundamentally new thing I learnt to work with in this project was e-commerce. This website was laso supposed to be an online shop. For this part I used Woocommerce. It turned out to be pretty easy to use and understand. Only, from what I can gather, usually the process of building an online shop starts with configuration of Woocommerce plugin, and then all other parts of the website go from there. I had to go backwards. My website was ready when it was decided to implement shop right there into it. It made things a little more difficult and inconvinient but still doable. Again, with Woocommerce the only thing difficult was to style shop pages back to the original design, edit some links and breadcrumbs and so on, and not to work with actual functioning parts.</p><p> This project is not finished yet. There is still a lot of work to be done with adaptiveness, with mobile version. The content needs work too in some places, and a shop is not filled with products yet.</p></div></body> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/modernizr/2.8.3/modernizr.min.js"></script> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="js/main.js"></script> </body></html>
