		<h2>Gutovska & Partners</h2>
		<em>Law Firm</em>

			The latest research, legal and business news overview provided by dedicated team of GUTOVSKA&Partners law company.

		<p>
			This website was my first client project. I was extremely excited and eager to finally try myself out. It was developed with only
			html, css and jQuery as well as the previous project. It was designed as a single-page application with navigation leading to
			corresponding sections with some scrolling effects.
		</p>
		<p>
			I didn't have drawn designs or any kind of instructions about what the finished product should look like. Of course I felt obligated
			to make the best of the situation. So I went ahead and turned every single section into a playing field. I tried out a whole lot of
			different effects and animations and templates. Of course eventually I came to my senses and got rid of some of those, because there
			really is such a thing as too much visual effects.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was also the first time ever I had to worry about responsiveness and adaptiveness. And, boy, was that some worry... Because this
			was done on very little experience the mobile-first approach didn't work well for me. To be honest I started working on mobile
			version when the desktop version (at least one of the early ones) was more or less done. So mostly I had to rewrite my styles and
			scripts anew for small devices and then add old ones through media queries. But sometimes I didn't have the patience and just added
			queries for small devices.
		</p>
		<p>
			It also took a lot of time to adapt all the animations for small devices. And of course in the end I got rid of most of them too.
			Because after all "keep it simple" is always the right approach.
		</p>
		<p>
			There were also some brand new aspects I had to learn to work with. Like google-maps for example, and contact-form that required some
			php-programming. Though later on I also added php-script as index-file for locale-determination as my website became multilingual
			(which brought a lot of headache as well as for some peculiar reason the content differed pretty strongly depending on a language).
			Image-sprites also became a new and interesting concept for me though on a much smaller scale of course.
		</p>
		<p>
			Speaking of sprites, the last but not least concept I had to learn was optimization. Aside from minimazing images and combining them
			into sprites (and, of course, using svg-images when posssible) I also minimized all my other files, connected libraries through CDN
			rather than placing them on the server with the rest of resources. At some point I even started using gulp for automatization of the
			project building process.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think I can safely say that this was the project, developing which I learned the most.
