I mean in the sense of finished projects. Once I came across a freelance project where a media website had to be developed, and it had to be done on Wordpress. Until that moment I've tried a few times to play around with Wordpress, to feel it out. But since I had practically no idea what it was about I had a hard time even in coming up with the idea of a project to try it on. So those tries basically lead to nothing. Naturally, when that project came up I had absolutely no time to waste, so I went ahead and started working on it long before negotiations were over. It was very hard and panicky because I was very much limited in time. But oddly enough it started to move along quicker and quicker. After I had chosen a theme I started working a lot with code. Even though nothing was decided yet in consideration to the project, even my own participation in it, I had the front-page design mockup, so I knew exactly what needed to be done. The front page consisted of many sections, as did my theme. First of all I had to learn to work with customizer. And so I did, I rewrote it pretty heavily according to my needs. After that I got to section-templates themselfs. I rewrote those too in accordance to my mockup and newly reconstructed customizer. To tell the truth, I had never worked this much with php before. I also had to use many custom fields and categories for the posts, which I used as holders for a pretty big part of my content, which also helped me a lot with making this website multilingual.</p><p> In a course of a few days I learned so much about working with wordpress as I couldn't do during my prior tries. I had developed almost entire front page when the negotiations about this project reached the final decision. And of course with my luck the decision was negative in consideration to my participation in it. I wasn't that much disapointed, because, after all, those few days, almost a week, I spent working on this project didn't really go to waste. I learned a whole lot and I was going to put this knowledge into work someday somehow.</p><p> But still, I didn't want all those things I worked on to go to waste either. So I decided to develop my own project where I could use them. I wanted for a long time to study Ukrainian embroidery - its history, its techniques, its regional divercities. It was and still is one of big passions of mine. I saw a good opportunity there to combine this research with realizing all that work I had done in existing project. And so I developed my own website dedicating it to a branch of my people's history I always highly respected and was amazed by. It is mostly informational website, where I put the main scope of the data I managed to gather in not a long time, but I also put a blog there, where I post pictures and descriptions of my own embroideries.</p><p> The description of the development process was pretty much the same as before. Though of course this time I knew what I was doing, and of course the website itself was very different, but I used a lot of the same concepts in the development. My website was not multilingual, so I didn't have to put my static content in posts. But my front page also consisted of a few sections, and all the content here came from a customizer. My posts still had custom fields though. I also played around some with different options for image galleries display.</p><p> This project along with its preface tought me how to work with Wordpress. I worked a lot with hard php-code (like customizer file or page and section templates) rather than using only Wordpress instruments, which helped me better to understand the structure of Wordpress theme, how it worked, what could be done with it and so on. I am most proud of this project, not because I learned so much developing it, at least not solely because of that, but also because of the work I did to provide content for it, and because of the topic of the project itself.</p></div></body> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/modernizr/2.8.3/modernizr.min.js"></script> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="js/main.js"></script> </body></html>
